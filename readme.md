# httpstatus.it

A simple status codes generator.

### Why This?

I created this project as a really simple tool for two specific purposes:

* practice a little bit with Go language;
* I needed a status code generator for a task, at work;

## Usage

```
-address string
    	server address as hostname:port e.g. 1337.my.org:443 (default "localhost:8080")
-certFile string
    	certificate file (try https://github.com/deckarep/EasyCert) (default "mycert1.cer")
-keyFile string
    	key file (try https://github.com/deckarep/EasyCert) (default "mycert1.key")
-tls
    	use https (ssl/tls) encryption
```
